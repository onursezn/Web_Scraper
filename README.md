### Web Scraper for Kitapyurdu and Idefix websites ###

- Created by using python package BeautifulSoup. It works on popular Turkish booksellersâ€™ websites. 
- Firstly, I created an algorithm for getting several thousands of book URLs, then I wrote another code snippet to obtain related information about the book such as ISBN, author, cover, etc. I used pandas library for data analysis of extracted data. 
- The learning outcomes of the project were dealing with large data, understanding of website structure and HTTP concepts.
